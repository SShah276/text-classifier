Original review: Cinematic masterpiece that absolutely landed perfectly by providing a proper send off to our favourite Avengers. A joke cracking, tear-jerking, action packed film that showed how even superhumans are flawed beings and can have failures to teach them the value of success. A sincere thanks to all the cast lead by RDJ and all the directorial crew involved from John to the Russo brothers for making these characters relatable and approachable in levels that had never been done in a superhero franchise. From an 8 year old gazing at the screen in amazement while watching Iron man to an 18 year old who just watched the Infinity Saga's end at the big screen almost bursting off with emotions, I can tell with a certainty that MCU had been with me for more than half of my life time up until now.This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. To see all 23 movies (i believe) combined into one with the perfect amount of focus on each character was honestly unbelievable and i don't know how they managed to create such a good film. My favourite part BY FAR was the battle scene where all the women teamed up and fought, it was honestly so incredibly empowering and it reminded me about what The Avengers were truly about, fighting injustice and encouraging empowerment whether that be in the other heroes or even in regular citizens who have been affected by the snap. I also want to add that they covered the vanish of 4 billion or-so people SO WELL, to see the city of San Francisco majority abandoned with the empty citi bank stadium and cars strewn and deteriorated after 5 years really set the mood for the direness of the situation and how depressing it was for the people who survived the snap. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Don't miss this movie it's really good

Original review: Ugh, this shows what you can get when you have ALL the money to do whatever you want to do. Having an infinite budget creates a fantastic looking movie, undoubtable: great score, effects, even the performances were great, they even did intelligent Hulk (no sure WHY), the plot isn't terrible, just awkward. It felt very "shoe horned", the director(s) clearly had very specific things they wanted to squeeze in this time around and got everyone of them on screen. There will be times where you're like, "Why is this happening now?" and there's your answer, because someone thought it looked cool on screen. My favorite being the "ultra feminist" moment when they isolated the ladies to one part of the battlefield...for some reason...and they all charged in together. Don't get me wrong and it was cool to see all the strong lady characters fight together (reminiscent of Age of Ultron's opening battle scene), it was just so FORCED that it calls it into question instead of just treating them like everyone else and coordinating the attacks.This is another one where its like they let the writers of the Walking Dead take a shot: they pull a bunch of important scenes from the comics only to change everything, and when they ran out of ideas, they did it again.Look, the movie is worth your time, it's definitely enjoyable on its own: I can't imagine anyone but real comic fans even getting the slightest bit upset about this one.

Original review: This film is horrible! I was so hyped, but what I got was a 3 hour piece of trash. Do not believe anybody who says this film is good. They just want to help the MCU as their childhood was full of Avengers. Endgame was a huge flop for me, and it doesn’t really deserve the highest grossing movie of all time as it had a competitive advantage over the other movies such as Avatar and Titanic. It had bigger and more cinemas than any other movie. Oh, did I mention fans of the MCU rewatching it a million times? Endgame was a flop as it had huge plot holes. Do you know the Soul infinity stone? It requires you to murder someone you love, and Thanos murdered Gamora to get it. Gamora wanted to die herself as a sacrifice, but Thanos was trying hard not to let her do that as he didn’t murder her and the soul stone wouldn’t be in his hands. In endgame, Natasha kills herself. Clint didn’t murder her. But how the heck did he get the stone? How??? And you can’t just pass over them soul stone to somebody else. They have to make a sacrifice. And yet Hulk can get it on  the Gauntlet after taking it. Like what? The time travel is so weird. I won’t even bother explaining it as you can see it for yourself. And in Infinity War, Iron Man’s helmet was destroyed and the Right. However, in Endgame his helmet was smashed on the left. And when Nebula and Tony are trapped in space, Brie just happens to appear out of nowhere. What a COINCIDENCE, endgame fans.

Original review: This is the most satisfying movie franchise conclusion I've ever seen. More than 20 movies have been leading up to this moment. Since Thanos wiped out half the universe, this movie focuses on the six Avengers from the first film. They also have Ant-Man, War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket to help accomplish their mission. This movie delivers with great action, emotional moments, and moments that will have you cheer the first time seeing it. The time travel in this film was different but still had a lot of fun with it. Iron Man and Captain America had great conclusions to their characters which I was really happy with. Black Widow's death will always be remembered. Thor being fat got a little old, but I appreciate actors and creators doing something different and I don't think it ruined Thor's character at all. I appreciate Hulk having a good mental conclusion; because in the first Avengers he talked about trying to kill himself in the past, and now he is a piece with himself which is great to see. Nebula surprisingly had a good arc as well. The stages of grief are very present in almost every character which I appreciate because that's what I think would happen if half your friends die. The portal scene was absolutely magical and will be known as one of the most iconic scenes ever. Also loved Wanda being super close to taking down Thanos because he killed Vision, but I knew ultimately it would have to be the big three that fight him last (Iron Man, Capt America, Thor).
